Reno is the certified hardware geek of the company. Eagle PCB software is always running on his computer. His workspace is a treasure hunt for electronic components and ICs. An avid camera collector, he loves taking photos with his many cameras from time to time. When not at work, you will either find him at the basketball court or playing chess online.
